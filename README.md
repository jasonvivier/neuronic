Program Name: Neuronic 1
Current Version -.0000000001 

This is just a list of scripts and functions I'm gathering up for the fun of it. 
Most of this won't apply to anyone else I suspect. But the general idea is to just put together scripts related to setting up Ubuntu servers for vulnerability assessments and to forward the results of those to my SSH server so I can do quarterly audits on a few systems I provide IT Security plans and ITMaaS 

I am going to make an attempt to organize all of this so that I can ulimately create a front end for some of it and also crunch it into a binary to make my life easier. 

I know most of these tools can be found in Parrot or Backtrack but I'm more interested in spending a little more time with them than just running them prebuilt. 

That is pretty much it. 

Take care.
